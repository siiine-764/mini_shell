Description:
I'd like to propose the addition of an enhanced command history feature in Minishell. The current command history functionality allows users to navigate through previous commands using the up and down arrow keys. However, I believe that enhancing this feature could significantly improve the user experience.

Key Features:

    Searchable Command History: Allow users to search for previous commands by typing a few characters and then navigating through the matching results using the arrow keys. This can save time and make it easier to find and repeat commands.

    Timestamps: Add timestamps to each command entry in the history, providing users with a reference to when a specific command was executed. This can be particularly helpful for debugging and auditing purposes.

    Favorite Commands: Allow users to mark certain commands as favorites or frequently used, making them easily accessible from a separate section of the history. This can streamline workflow for repetitive tasks.

    Customizable History Length: Permit users to configure the maximum number of commands stored in the history. This can be useful for users with limited disk space or specific workflow requirements.

    Export and Import History: Enable users to export their command history to a file, making it easy to back up and share history across different installations. Importing a history file would allow users to restore their command history.

Benefits:

    Improved usability and efficiency for both novice and experienced users.
    Better support for debugging, with timestamps aiding in identifying when issues occurred.
    Customizability for users with specific workflow requirements.
    Enhanced history management with the ability to export and import history.

Implementation Ideas:
This feature could be implemented by extending the current command history module or by integrating external libraries that provide advanced history management.
